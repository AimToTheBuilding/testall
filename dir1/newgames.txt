 Let us examine this program line by line to ascertain its meaning. Some hand-waving will be necessary, since some of the concepts will not be presented until later. However, this code is simple enough that you need not yet understand completely what each line is doing.

The next line is a variable declaration. When in @module{strict} mode (set by the use strict pragma), all variables must be declared. In this case, Perl's @keyword{my} keyword is used to declare the variable @scalar{$username}. A variable like @scalar{$username} that starts with a $ is said to be a scalar variable. For more information on scalar variables, see 2. Working with Scalars. For now, just be aware that scalar variables can hold strings.
